Worked with Mike on a Royal Enfield I was interested in getting who was very easy going and had a heart of gold.","Those guys are amazing!! I called to see if they have any off road equipment in stock, they were the onlyest in Brooklyn to have so. When they answered the call Marcus answered - pleasant customer service - answered all my questions professionally as u needed!","Super grateful to Sean for helping me find the right bike for my size and skill level, and to Roseann for talking me through the whole financing process. My bike fits me perfectly.","Top notch guys. Great service, friendly, and fair prices. Support your local bike shops; the big dealerships won't miss you.","Sean & Micky sold me a scooter with registration and license plate, everything out the door in 24 hours! I'm so glad to have an awesome shop in the neighborhood. Thanks y'all, coming back to get me a Bullet 350 next ;)","Sean and Dustin were super helpful when picking up my NIU scooter. They were super patient with me when the scooter arrived late from China, answering every question I had and keeping me up to date with info as soon as they got it. They helped me outfit it with accessories and we're super nice with figuring out all the details so I could leave same day with my ride. Great guys!","Took my bike here for inspection. The shop owner showed me what needed to be fixed and was able to complete everything within 24 hours. Very professional interaction and will definitely be coming back for future service.","My experience with scooters was limited to Revel before I bought a Genuine Buddy 50cc of my own, so I was somewhat apprehensive. Nicole, Justin, and Sean were great to work with throughout this process.  They answered all of my questions thoroughly and never made me feel weird about being inexperienced.","As a new rider I had the expectation that I would be taken advantage of, infact the exact opposite happened. The staff and owner gave me very valuable information as a new rider and took very good care of a bike I had purchased from a private owner Ducati monster 620 03.","Great shop. Turned my bike around quick, didn't even charge for parts on a small repair. Nice guys, too.","These guys care. I needed a simple battery charge.  They took time to help me and treated me like I was buying a brand new bike. Solid owner and team.","Almost too nice haha! Its a moto shop, so i usually expect some proper gruff treatment and some roasting for calling something the wrong name. But not these guys! Cool NY guys who know their machines, and will treat you right. They dont rush or badger you into things you don't want or need.","Sean and team kill it!  Had a slow leak and needed a complete tune up before a long weekend ride and these guys turned it around in a couple hours.  Great service and good advice.  I'd recommend.","Purchased a Buddy scooter a few months ago and have been going here for service ever since. The owner, Sean, is a great guy and they do good work! I will continue doing business here because the customer service is outstanding.","Sean has always taken great care of me, especially in a pinch. He's towed my bike a few times (flats, snapped throttle cable, etc.) and made it as smooth as possible so I can make it to work while he handles business. Even though he's a Patriots fan, I'm backing him.","Sean and Justin are awesome. I bring my 2014 kawasaki here for all its needs. They always service it in a timely fashion, keep me posted with any updates with a phone call and are above and beyond friendly. Also realistic and reasonable with prices on products and labor. Not the cheapest Iv ever seen but also never got screwed. Come check this place out.","Brooklyn Mayd Powersports products service is no doubt a 10/10. There team helped me out with everything that i was looking for & i am really thankful for that. Sean is very Passionate about giving his customers exactly what they are looking for and excellent customer service is what he gives.","Had my Husqvarna serviced at Brooklyn Mayd. I also had them install rear blinkers on my bike. Justin, and the owner Sean treated my bike and I perfectly. These are great guys who will do you and your bike just. Highly reccomend them; I will be coming back for my next service and any other customizations I need done on my bike.","Sean and his team are amazing. Super solid, stand-up people who helped me out when my scooter was stolen, completely trashed, and then recovered by the police. They got the scooter up and running perfectly and helped so much in dealing with insurance.","Shawn and his team are amazing!! Time and time again they surprise me with their generosity and professionalism. If you're looking for a shop look no further. They've made a lifelong customer out of me.","Quality service, good prices, and get your bike back when they say you getting it back or sooner!","Great shop! Been in business forever for good reason. Neighborhood feel with super nice and knowledgeable people.","Thanks to Sean and his team. Great service. I ordered a rear tire and he matched the price I found online. I showed up as they were closing on a Friday expecting to have to leave the bike and Sean installed and balanced the tire himself in 10 minutes for a good price. Really happy to have found them. They have really nice bikes for sale too.","The new owner bought Y2K and it's great that he did. The people there are much more knowledgable and personable, and they got my bike done super fast.","Great Service!
